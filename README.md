# Computer_Vision
This project is used to learn about computer vision. This will be using python, pytorch and OpenCV.

## Fashion MNIST DATASET
This will use [Learn Pytroch youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org),  [Learn Pytroch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) and (jupyter notebook)[https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/03_pytorch_computer_vision.ipynb]

## CIFAR DATASET
The file called transfer learning, use CIFAR100 data to understand how to use trasnfer learning. 

Transfer learning allows us to take the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and use them for our own problem.

For example, we can take the patterns a computer vision model has learned from datasets such as ImageNet (millions of images of different objects) and use them to power our FoodVision Mini model.
Or we could take the patterns from a language model (a model that's been through large amounts of text to learn a representation of language) and use them as the basis of a model to classify different text samples.

Using [Pytorch Transfer learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/).
